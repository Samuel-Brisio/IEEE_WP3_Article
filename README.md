**[Change this line]** Innovative approach for the analysis of electromagnetic transients generated by the integration of distributed energy resources in power systems

The paper associated with this work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Latin America Transactions (Submission ID: 9287).

This repository contains the simulation file and the necessary codes to process data from EMT simulations performed on a power system with the integration of distributed generation based on solar systems.

### Create Python Environment

Go inside the folder "Scripts/Python_Script" and execute

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating Kubernet Environment

To create the kubernet Environment it's need to do the following steps:
- Create Image
- Setup Environment
    - Create Environment
    - Isolate Environment
    - OVS Configuration

#### Creating Image

Go to the folder "Imagens", then read the README for the instructions to create the images

#### Setup the Environment

Inside the folder of this repository execute the following commandas.

##### Create the Kubernet Environment
```
./setup_environment.sh
```

##### Isolate the Environment

To isolate the environment from acessing the internet we need to know the ip address the kubernet create in the previus command use.


Exemple


```
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
wp3-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   20d   v1.25.3   172.18.0.5    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.9
wp3-worker          Ready    <none>          20d   v1.25.3   172.18.0.2    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.9
wp3-worker2         Ready    <none>          20d   v1.25.3   172.18.0.3    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.9
wp3-worker3         Ready    <none>          20d   v1.25.3   172.18.0.4    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.9
wp3-worker4         Ready    <none>          20d   v1.25.3   172.18.0.6    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.9
```
Therefore in this case the environment uses 172.18.0.0 range, so when executing `sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING` we get a list of ip rules inclusive the one connecting the Testbed to the internet.

```
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt    source        destination         
MASQUERADE  all  --  172.17.0.0/16    anywhere            
MASQUERADE  tcp  --  172.18.0.5       172.18.0.5    tcp dpt:6443
MASQUERADE  all  --  172.18.0.0/16    anywhere 
```

To remove the rule that connects the cluster to the Internet, it is necessary to identify its position and remove it by executing the command below. For example, the rule that connects the cluster to the Internet is located at position 3.

```
$ sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING 3
```

##### OVS Configuration
```
./Deploy/OVS/creating_network.sh
./Deploy/OVS/config_network.sh
```

### Executing the Environment


#### Run the experiments
```
./Scripts/fase_04/batch.sh <Number-of-Emulation>
# Exemple -> To run 35 emulations
./Scripts/fase_04/batch.sh 35
```

Each emulation will be save in a compact format inside the folder Emulation_Raw_Data

#### Getting the metrics from the raw data
```
mkdir Analysis
```

```
./Scripts/fase_04/analysis.sh <OUTPUT_DIR> <RAW_DATA_DIR>
# Exemple
./Scripts/fase_04/analysis.sh Analysis Emulation_Raw_Data
```
